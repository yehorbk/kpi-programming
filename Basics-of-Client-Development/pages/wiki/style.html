      Retro style is a style that is imitative or consciously derivative of lifestyles,
      trends, or art forms from the historical past, including in music, modes, fashions, or attitudes.
      In popular culture, the "nostalgia cycle" is typically for the two decades that are 20-30 years
      before the current one.

      The term retro has been in use since 1972 to describe on the one hand, new artifacts that
      self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past.
      But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the
      past. Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the
      historicism of the Romantic generations, it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate,
      focusing on the products, fashions and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the
      successive styles of Modernity. The English word retro derives from the Latin prefix retro, meaning
      backwards, or in past times.

      In France, the word retro, an abbreviation for retrospectif, gained cultural currency with reevaluations of
      Charles de Gaulle and France's role in World War II. The French mode retro of the 1970s reappraised in film and
      novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term retro was soon applied to nostalgic
      French fashions that recalled the same period.

      Shortly thereafter retro was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather
      cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions. In Simulacra and Simulation, French theorist Jean
      Baudrillard describes retro as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that
      drove
      the modern age.

      Most commonly retro is used to describe objects and attitudes from the recent past that never seem modern. It
      suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of
      revivalism,
      "retro" suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an
      "unsentimental
      nostalgia", recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of nostalgia is linked to retro,
      but
      the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro
      shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment. The desire to capture something from the past and
      evoke
      nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.
