## The list of main functions
- ```getMatrix``` - get matrix from specific function and two another matrices
- ```compose``` - matrix composition
- ```isReflexive``` - check is matrix reflexive
- ```isAntiReflexive``` - check is matrix anti-reflexive
- ```isSymmetric``` - check is matrix symmetric
- ```isAntiSymmetric``` - check is matrix anti-symmetric
- ```isTransitive``` - check is matrix transitive
- ```isRelationOfOrder``` - check is matrix have 'order' relations
