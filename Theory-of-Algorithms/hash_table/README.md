# Hash-Tables
Hash tables can be used to store an arrays of data, fast access, insertion and 
deletion of elements. With hash-tables you can effetely solve the next task. 
We have an array of numbers A and the number S. You need to find out if there
are two elements in array A whose amount is equal to S. 

## Variant of task
In this work you need to implement different types of hash-tables with using 
of  different hash-functions to solve the problem above. Also you must 
compare the performance of different approaches by calculating the number of
collisions for each type of hash function and hash table.
