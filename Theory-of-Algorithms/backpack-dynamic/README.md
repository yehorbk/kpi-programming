# Dynamic Programming
Implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm for the backpack 
problem.
Dynamic programming is a powerful enough method for developing 
algorithms for solving problems that can be decomposed into smaller 
problems, from which, the initial problem is solved.

## Variant of task
Applying dynamic programming to the backpack problem is one of the prime 
examples of the power of this approach. The problem is formulated as follows.
Given are n different items known about their size, or weight, wi, and cost vi. 
Also given a backpack in which to put these items. The backpack is known for 
its capacity (total size, or weight, of items that can be placed in it) - W. 
It is necessary to select a set of items S among all given items that (1) their 
total dimension does not exceed the capacity of the backpack W and (2) the 
total value of the objects in the set S is the highest possible among 
all other sets.
