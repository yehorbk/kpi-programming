# Decomposition method. Search for inversions
Using the decomposition method to develop an algorithm and find the number 
of degrees of liking (number of inversions). 

## Variant of task
Use a decomposition method to develop an algorithm that will solve the 
following problem.
Incoming data. Matrix D of natural numbers of dimension uÂ´m, where u are the 
number of users, m is the number of films. Each element of the matrix D [i, j] 
indicates the position of the movie j in the list of user preferences i. Another 
input is the x number of the user, which will be compared with the numbers of 
all other users.
Output data. List of ascending second element of pairs (i, c), where i is the user 
number, c is a number indicating the degree of similarity of the users' 
preferences x and c (number of inversions).
